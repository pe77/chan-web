			<p>77chan is a imageboard focused on anonymity. That is, a place where you can post the funking shit you want* anonymously**.
			</p>

			<p>
			Despite the quick registration using your Google+ account, your personal data is not connected directly to your posts / replies and are not publicly available.
			</p>

			<p>
			Friendly interface and objective. With just 3 clicks to its initial pseudo-register, you can already leave posting. Simple that! Without any bullshit.
			</p>

			<p>
			That's it! Feel free to keeping shitting around and dont forget to read the rules!
